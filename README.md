# Real-Time-3D-Reconstruction-in-VR
Our project aims to transform raw mono camera data captured by a Turtlebot 4 robot into a fully immersive virtual reality (VR) experience. By employing the TurtleBot 4 robot equipped with a mono camera, we capture and process RGB images in real-time, transmitting them to an external machine for 3D reconstruction. Leveraging ROS2 for communication, ORB-SLAM3 for real-time 3D reconstruction, and Unity for VR development, our pipeline integrates hardware, software, and advanced algorithms to create an engaging and interactive virtual world. This solution empowers remote users to interact with a real 3D environment, addressing challenges prevalent in industries where physical presence is often impractical. 
The robot will be localized in its environment using SLAM technique in order to be able to self navigate in its environment. While navigating in its environment, the camera sensor is used to capture and record the environment after which the data is then sent through ROS stack over Wi-Fi to an external machine that will do the 3D reconstruction. Then, we can visualize the scene in VR which would complete the minimum pipeline
