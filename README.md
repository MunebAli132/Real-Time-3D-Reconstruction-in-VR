# Project Title: Real-Time 3D Reconstruction in VR

## Overview

Welcome to our project repository! Our goal is to transform raw mono camera data captured by a TurtleBot 4 robot into a fully immersive virtual reality (VR) experience. This project combines hardware, software, and advanced algorithms to create an engaging and interactive virtual world. By leveraging ROS2 for communication, ORB-SLAM3 for real-time 3D reconstruction, and Unity for VR development, our pipeline addresses challenges prevalent in industries where physical presence is often impractical.

## Project Features

- **Mono Camera Data Transformation:** The TurtleBot 4, equipped with a mono camera, captures and processes real-time RGB images.

- **ROS2 Communication:** Utilizing ROS2 for seamless communication between the robot's components, we ensure efficient data flow and control.

- **Real-time 3D Reconstruction:** ORB-SLAM3 is employed for real-time 3D reconstruction of the environment, enhancing the robot's spatial awareness.

- **Unity VR Development:** The pipeline integrates with Unity to provide a fully immersive VR experience for users.

- **Remote Interaction:** Empowers remote users to interact with a real 3D environment, catering to industries where physical presence is challenging.

## Getting Started

1. **Requirements:**
   - TurtleBot 4 with a mono camera
   - ROS2 installation
   - ORB-SLAM3
   - Unity for VR development

2. **Installation:**
   - Clone this repository .
   - Follow setup instructions in the respective ROS, ORB-SLAM3, and Unity documentation.

3. **Usage:**
   - Launch the ROS nodes on the TurtleBot: `roslaunch turtlebot_launch turtlebot_launch_file.launch`
   - Run ORB-SLAM3 for 3D reconstruction.
   - Start Unity VR application for immersive experience.

## Workflow

1. The TurtleBot navigates its environment using SLAM techniques, capturing RGB images with the mono camera.

2. Data is transmitted over Wi-Fi to an external machine through the ROS stack.

3. The external machine performs 3D reconstruction using ORB-SLAM3.

4. Visualize the reconstructed scene in Unity, completing the minimum pipeline.
